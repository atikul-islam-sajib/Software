UML Diagram: A UML diagram is a diagram based on the UML (Unified Modeling Language) with the purpose of visually representing a system along with its main actors, roles, actions, artifacts or classes, in order to better understand, alter,maintain, or document information about the system. For this, I have chosen the following three diagrams:

						  1. Activity Diagram
						  2. Use Case Diagram
						  3. State Diagram
              
          
1. Activity Diagram:

Python checker allows to check your Python code syntax (Python 3), and find Python errors. This Python code checker tool highlights and goes to line with a syntax error.

Python tester and checker allows to test Python code Online without install, all you need is a browser. You can test your Python code easily and quickly.

This python sandbox uses Brython (BSD 3-Clause "New" or "Revised" License), it is a Python 3 implementation for client-side web programming. Brython is designed to replace Javascript for the Web. It is an interesting project!

Be careful, there may be differences between the result obtained on this page, and the result you would obtain with a python interpreter.
This page just allows you to quickly test a few lines of code.

                                 
				PyChecker is a static analysis tool for Python that checks your code for common errors and issues. 
				It can help you find problems in your code before you run it, which can save you time and reduce the risk of bugs and other issues.
				
				Similarly, python-tester is a third-party testing framework that is popular in the Python community. 
				It offers a more concise syntax for writing tests, and provides a number of advanced features such as
				fixtures for setting up test data and parametrized testing.

				Here are some of the common issues that PyChecker and python-tester can help you detect:
				--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

			        1. Undefined variables: It can detect when you try to use a variable that has not been defined in your code.

				2. Unused variables: It can detect when you define a variable but never use it in your code.

				3. Unused imports: It can detect when you import a module but never use any of its functions or classes.

				4. Function call errors: It can detect when you call a function with the wrong number or type of arguments.

                                5. Attribute errors: It can detect when you try to access an attribute that does not exist on an object.
				
				
				

`In this software, there is some red mark will be appeared, it does not mean that the code that I written is wrong. There is given some update, for example, Indentation, make space between two functions call etc. If we hover to the red mark then there is a tooltiptext would be apperaed there all the necessity steps are written.`

Clean Code Development: Clean code is code that is easy to understand and easy to change. In my project, I try to do clean coding. here are five points to show you clean code in Python:

1. Use of descriptive variable names: When writing clean code, it's important to use descriptive variable names that are easy to understand. This makes the code more readable and maintainable. For example, instead of using a variable name like "a", you can use a more descriptive name like "num_of_items" or "customer_name".

2. Proper indentation: Python relies on indentation to define the scope of code blocks. Therefore, it's important to use proper indentation to make your code more readable. For example, each level of indentation should be four spaces.

3. Avoid long lines: Long lines of code can be difficult to read and understand. It's recommended to keep lines of code to a maximum of 79 characters. If a line needs to be longer than this, you can split it into multiple lines using parentheses.

4. Use of comments: Comments are useful for explaining what your code is doing and why you're doing it. However, it's important to use them sparingly and only when necessary. Too many comments can clutter your code and make it harder to read.

5. Consistent naming conventions: When naming variables, functions, and classes, it's important to follow a consistent naming convention. This makes it easier to understand the purpose of each item in your code. For example, you can use camelCase or snake_case for variable names, depending on your personal preference.

======================== For 9 ========================

Integrated Development Environment(IDE): I used Google Colab Pro and Visual Studio as well to this project. I am going to describe the benefits of using those IDE's in here.

Here are some benefits of using Google Colab Pro:
------------------------------------------------

1. More powerful hardware: With Colab Pro, I get access to more powerful GPUs, TPUs, and CPUs compared to the free version. This means you can run more complex and larger models faster and more efficiently. In this code, I used P100 tesla and 32 GB High Ram to train the model.

2. Longer runtimes: Colab Pro offers longer runtimes compared to the free version, which allows you to train larger models that require more time to run.

3. More memory and storage: Colab Pro offers more RAM and disk storage than the free version, which can be crucial when working with large datasets.

4. Priority access: Colab Pro subscribers get priority access to Google's computing resources, which means that your jobs will be queued and run faster than the free version.

5. Collaborative features: With Colab Pro, you can collaborate with others in real-time, making it easier to work on projects with a team or get help from others.

6. No interruption: Colab Pro users get uninterrupted access to computing resources, which means that your sessions will not be interrupted or terminated after a certain amount of time.

7. Access to premium libraries: Colab Pro users can access premium libraries and services such as Google Drive, Google Sheets, and Google BigQuery, which can be helpful when working on data-intensive projects.

8. Affordable pricing: Colab Pro is significantly more affordable compared to other cloud computing platforms, making it accessible to a wider range of users.

Overall, Google Colab Pro offers many benefits for data scientists, machine learning practitioners, and researchers who need access to powerful computing resources without breaking the bank. It is very useful when solving Image Classification task because it will take too much time to train if there is no High Ram.

According to me, I like their `More powerful hardware`, `Collaborative features` and `More memory and storage` that is really useful for training the big dataset.

Besides, Visual Studio is a popular Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that provides a comprehensive set of tools for developing Python applications. I used it as well.

Here are some reasons why Visual Studio is considered easy for Python development:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. User-friendly interface: Visual Studio provides a user-friendly interface with features like Intellisense, which offers intelligent code completion, making it easy for developers to write Python code quickly and efficiently.

2. Rich set of features: Visual Studio provides a rich set of features, including debugging, profiling, unit testing, and code analysis, which help developers to write high-quality Python code.

3. Cross-platform support: Visual Studio supports cross-platform Python development, allowing developers to write Python code that runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
Integration with popular Python frameworks and libraries: Visual Studio integrates seamlessly with popular Python frameworks and libraries like Django, Flask, and NumPy, making it easy for developers to create applications using these frameworks.

4. Collaboration tools: Visual Studio provides collaboration tools like Git integration and Live Share, which allow developers to work together on the same project in real-time, making it easy for teams to collaborate on Python projects.


Overall, Visual Studio provides a comprehensive set of tools and features that make it easy for developers to write, test, and deploy Python applications.

In this IDE, I like their `Rich set of features`, `Collaboration tools` & `User-friendly interface` tools that really make my coding easier and flexible.

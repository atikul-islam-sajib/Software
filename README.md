======================== For 1 ========================

Project Code: As soon as I finished each module,I put the code for each on my

======================== For 2 ========================

UML Diagram: A UML diagram is a diagram based on the UML (Unified Modeling Language) with the purpose of visually representing a system along with its main actors, roles, actions, artifacts or classes, in order to better understand, alter,maintain, or document information about the system. For this, I have chosen the following three diagrams:

						  1. Activity Diagram
						  2. Use Case Diagram
						  3. State Diagram
              
          
1. Activity Diagram:

2. Use Case Diagram:

3. State Diagram

Domain Driven Design(DDD): Domain-driven design (DDD) is a software design approach focusing on modelling software to match a domain according to input from that domain's experts. The DDD of my project given below->

======================== For 4===========================

Python checker allows to check Python code syntax, and find Python errors and these tool highlights and goes to line with a syntax error.
Python tester and checker allows to test Python code Online without install, all We need is a browser.
				
Some of the common issues can detect given below:

1. Undefined variables

2. Unused variables

3. Unused imports

4. Function call errors

5. Attribute errors
				
				
`In this software, there is some red mark will be appeared, it does not mean that the code that I written is wrong. There is given some update, for example, Indentation, make space between two functions call etc that was mentioned in the above points. If I hover to the red mark then there is a tooltiptext would be apperaed there all the necessity steps are written.`

======================== For 5(A) ========================

Clean Code Development: Clean code is code that is easy to understand and easy to change. In my project, I try to do clean coding. here are five points to show you clean code in Python:

1. Appropriate name for variable and method : Variable name must define the exact explanation of its content.

	link: https://github.com/atikul-islam-sajib/Software/blob/main/Cleaning_Code/Screenshot_20230122_042259.png

2. Appropriate indentation: Python depends on indentation to define the scope of code blocks.

3. Avoid long lines: Long lines of code can be difficult to read and understand most of the cases.

4. Use of comments: it's important to use them sparingly and only when necessary.

5. Consistent naming conventions: When naming variables, functions, and classes, it's important to follow a consistent naming convention.

The personal CCD cheat Sheet E.g. a PDF link is given below:

======================== For 7 ========================

Unit test: Unit Testing is a type of software testing where individual units or components of a software are tested. For my project the unit test link is given below:

https://github.com/atikul-islam-sajib/Software/blob/bc8e79106166382b6349c16f3f7a2c23aa01042e/Project/colon_cancer_classification_using_cnn_%26_transfer_learning_%26_fine_tuning%20updated1.py#L743-L791

========================= For 8 ========================

Implementing a simple Python CI/CD pipeline using Github Actions. The link is given below:

======================== For 9 ========================

Integrated Development Environment(IDE): I used Google Colab pro a web IDE for python. 

In Google Colab pro my fav key-shortcuts is:

1. Insert code cell using `ctrl + m + b` easily. More or less I used 40+ cell to write the code and evaluating the model.
2. Delete cell using `ctrl + m + d` - when the cell is not necessary.
3. Mount  GOOGLE DRIVE TO Colab. Just click `Copy to Drive` to mount the drive. That helped me to access the drive where all my image dataset present.
4. Active GPU & TPU just clicking `Runtime → Change runtime type → Hardware accelerator`.
5. Run BASH Commands, for example, if I want to clone git repository then run it on the cell `!git clone <REPOSITORY URL>`
6. Use TENSORBOARD With Colab - It is useful for deep learning because it will give the proper information about loss and accuracy plot in each epoch. run `%load_ext tensorboard` in the cell.

======================== For 11 ========================

Functinal Programming: Functional programming (FP) is an approach to software development that uses pure functions to create maintainable software. In other words, building programs by applying and composing functions.

I used some of the given functinal programming concept on my codebase. Some of points are implemented in functional_programming.ipynb. 
1. Side Effect free function:

2. The use of higher-order functions:

3. anonymous functions:

4. Functions as parametrs and return values

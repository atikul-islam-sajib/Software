======================== For 1 ========================

Project Code: As soon as I finished each module,I put the code for each on my

======================== For 2 ========================

UML Diagram: A UML diagram is a diagram based on the UML (Unified Modeling Language) with the purpose of visually representing a system along with its main actors, roles, actions, artifacts or classes, in order to better understand, alter,maintain, or document information about the system. For this, I have chosen the following three diagrams:

						  1. Activity Diagram
						  2. Use Case Diagram
						  3. State Diagram
              
          
1. Activity Diagram:

2. Use Case Diagram:

Domain Driven Design(DDD): Domain-driven design (DDD) is a software design approach focusing on modelling software to match a domain according to input from that domain's experts. The DDD of my project given below->

======================== For 4===========================

Python checker allows to check your Python code syntax (Python 3), and find Python errors. This Python code checker tool highlights and goes to line with a syntax error.

Python tester and checker allows to test Python code Online without install, all you need is a browser. You can test your Python code easily and quickly.

This python sandbox uses Brython (BSD 3-Clause "New" or "Revised" License), it is a Python 3 implementation for client-side web programming. Brython is designed to replace Javascript for the Web. It is an interesting project!

Be careful, there may be differences between the result obtained on this page, and the result you would obtain with a python interpreter.
This page just allows you to quickly test a few lines of code.

======================== For 5(A) ========================

Clean Code Development: Clean code is code that is easy to understand and easy to change. In my project, I try to do clean coding. Five points for clean code:

 						Use proper name for variable and method.
 						Single purpose method.
						Write comment when needed.
						Don't use large number parameters.
						Handle error properly.
						All of Screnshort can be found in this link:

======================== For 7 ========================

Unit test: Unit Testing is a type of software testing where individual units or components of a software are tested. For my project the unit test link is given below:

======================== For 9 ========================

Integrated Development Environment(IDE):

Visual Studio is a popular Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that provides a comprehensive set of tools for developing Python applications. Here are some reasons why Visual Studio is considered easy for Python development:

1. User-friendly interface: Visual Studio provides a user-friendly interface with features like Intellisense, which offers intelligent code completion, making it easy for developers to write Python code quickly and efficiently.

2. Rich set of features: Visual Studio provides a rich set of features, including debugging, profiling, unit testing, and code analysis, which help developers to write high-quality Python code.

3. Cross-platform support: Visual Studio supports cross-platform Python development, allowing developers to write Python code that runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
Integration with popular Python frameworks and libraries: Visual Studio integrates seamlessly with popular Python frameworks and libraries like Django, Flask, and NumPy, making it easy for developers to create applications using these frameworks.

4. Collaboration tools: Visual Studio provides collaboration tools like Git integration and Live Share, which allow developers to work together on the same project in real-time, making it easy for teams to collaborate on Python projects.


Overall, Visual Studio provides a comprehensive set of tools and features that make it easy for developers to write, test, and deploy Python applications.

======================== For 11 ========================

Functinal Programming: Functional programming (FP) is an approach to software development that uses pure functions to create maintainable software. In other words, building programs by applying and composing functions.

I used some of the given functinal programming concept on my codebase. Some of points are implemented in functional_programming.ipynb.

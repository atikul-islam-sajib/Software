======================== For 1 ========================

Project Code: As soon as I finished each module,I put the code for each on my

https://github.com/atikul-islam-sajib/Software/tree/main/Project


======================== For 2 ========================

UML Diagram: A UML diagram is a diagram based on the UML (Unified Modeling Language) with the purpose of visually representing a system along with its main actors, roles, actions, artifacts or classes, in order to better understand, alter,maintain, or document information about the system. For this, I have chosen the following three diagrams:

						  1. Activity Diagram
						  2. Use Case Diagram
						  3. State Diagram
              
          
1. Activity Diagram:

2. Use Case Diagram:

3. State Diagram

======================== For 3 ========================

Domain Driven Design(DDD): Domain-driven design (DDD) is a software design approach focusing on modelling software to match a domain according to input from that domain's experts. The DDD of my project given below->

======================== For 4===========================

Python checker allows to check your Python code syntax (Python 3), and find Python errors. This Python code checker tool highlights and goes to line with a syntax error.

The Screenshoot is given below:

======================== For 5(A) ========================

Clean Code Development: Clean code is code that is easy to understand and easy to change. In my project, I try to do clean coding. Five points for clean code:

 						Use proper name for variable and method.
 						Single purpose method.
						Write comment when needed.
						Don't use large number parameters.
						Handle error properly.
						All of Screnshort can be found in this link:

========================  For 5(B) ========================

Cheat Sheet: I write a cheat sheet for python programming. The link is given below:

======================== For 7 ========================

Unit test: Unit Testing is a type of software testing where individual units or components of a software are tested. For my project the unit test link is given below:

========================= For 8 ========================

Implementing a simple Python CI/CD pipeline using Github Actions. The link is given below:

======================== For 9 ========================

Integrated Development Environment(IDE): I used anaconda and jupyter notebook and Specially Google Colab Pro as my IDE. 
My favourite shortcut is: write first few words and hit tab, Easy links to documentation, Plotting in notebooks, and IPython Magic â€“ Timing.


======================== For 11 ========================

Functinal Programming: Functional programming (FP) is an approach to software development that uses pure functions to create maintainable software. In other words, building programs by applying and composing functions.

I used some of the given functinal programming concept on my codebase. Some of points are implemented in functional_programming.ipynb.

UML Diagram: A UML diagram is a diagram based on the UML (Unified Modeling Language) with the purpose of visually representing a system along with its main actors, roles, actions, artifacts or classes, in order to better understand, alter,maintain, or document information about the system. For this, I have chosen the following three diagrams:

						  1. Activity Diagram
						  2. Use Case Diagram
						  3. State Diagram
              
          
1. Activity Diagram:

2. Use Case Diagram:

3. State Diagram

Domain Driven Design(DDD): Domain-driven design (DDD) is a software design approach focusing on modelling software to match a domain according to input from that domain's experts. The DDD of my project given below->

======================== For 4===========================

Python checker allows to check your Python code syntax (Python 3), and find Python errors. This Python code checker tool highlights and goes to line with a syntax error.

Python tester and checker allows to test Python code Online without install, all you need is a browser. You can test your Python code easily and quickly.

This python sandbox uses Brython (BSD 3-Clause "New" or "Revised" License), it is a Python 3 implementation for client-side web programming. Brython is designed to replace Javascript for the Web. It is an interesting project!

Be careful, there may be differences between the result obtained on this page, and the result you would obtain with a python interpreter.
This page just allows you to quickly test a few lines of code.

                                 
				PyChecker is a static analysis tool for Python that checks your code for common errors and issues. 
				It can help you find problems in your code before you run it, which can save you time and reduce the risk of bugs and other issues.
				
				Similarly, python-tester is a third-party testing framework that is popular in the Python community. 
				It offers a more concise syntax for writing tests, and provides a number of advanced features such as
				fixtures for setting up test data and parametrized testing.

				Here are some of the common issues that PyChecker and python-tester can help you detect:
				--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

			        1. Undefined variables: It can detect when you try to use a variable that has not been defined in your code.

				2. Unused variables: It can detect when you define a variable but never use it in your code.

				3. Unused imports: It can detect when you import a module but never use any of its functions or classes.

				4. Function call errors: It can detect when you call a function with the wrong number or type of arguments.

                                5. Attribute errors: It can detect when you try to access an attribute that does not exist on an object.
				
				
				

`In this software, there is some red mark will be appeared, it does not mean that the code that I written is wrong. There is given some update, for example, Indentation, make space between two functions call etc. If we hover to the red mark then there is a tooltiptext would be apperaed there all the necessity steps are written.`

Clean Code Development: Clean code is code that is easy to understand and easy to change. In my project, I try to do clean coding. here are five points to show you clean code in Python:

1. Use proper name for variable and method : Variable name must define the exact explanation of its content.

	link: https://github.com/atikul-islam-sajib/Software/blob/main/Cleaning_Code/Screenshot_20230122_042259.png

2. Proper indentation: Python relies on indentation to define the scope of code blocks.

3. Avoid long lines: Long lines of code can be difficult to read and understand.

	link: https://github.com/atikul-islam-sajib/Software/blob/main/Cleaning_Code/cleaning_code_1.png

4. Use of comments: it's important to use them sparingly and only when necessary.
	link: https://github.com/atikul-islam-sajib/Software/blob/main/Cleaning_Code/cleaning_code_3.png

5. Consistent naming conventions: When naming variables, functions, and classes, it's important to follow a consistent naming convention.

The personal CCD cheat Sheet E.g. a PDF link is given below:

Here, The 10 points I have mentioned:


1. Use meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes
2. Write small and focused functions
3. Use comments sparingly and only when necessary
4. Follow the PEP 8 style guide
5. Use docstrings to document functions and classes
6. Write tests for your code
7. Use exceptions to handle errors
8. Use constants or configuration files instead of hardcoding values
9. Write simple and readable code
10. Use built-in functions and libraries

The 10 points of CCD LINK is given below:

This is the optional Cheat Sheet of using Neural Network and CNN architecture from the project, it is used for the learning purpose.

The architecture of NN and CNN cheat sheet is given below:

======================== For 7 ========================

Unit test: Unit Testing is a type of software testing where individual units or components of a software are tested. For my project the unit test link is given below:

======================== For 9 ========================

Integrated Development Environment(IDE): I used Google Colab pro a web IDE for python. 

In Google Colab pro my fav key-shortcuts is:

1. Insert code cell using `ctrl + m + b`
2. Delete cell using `ctrl + m + d`
3. Mount  GOOGLE DRIVE TO Colab. Just click `Copy to Drive` to mount the drive.
4. Active GPU & TPU just clicking `Runtime → Change runtime type → Hardware accelerator`
5. Run BASH Commands, for example, if I want to clone git repository then run it on the cell `!git clone <REPOSITORY URL>`
6. Use TENSORBOARD With Colab - It is useful for deep learning because it will give the proper information about loss and accuracy plot in each epoch. run `%load_ext tensorboard` in the cell.

======================== For 11 ========================

Functinal Programming: Functional programming (FP) is an approach to software development that uses pure functions to create maintainable software. In other words, building programs by applying and composing functions.

I used some of the given functinal programming concept on my codebase. Some of points are implemented in functional_programming.ipynb. 
1. Side Effect free function:
